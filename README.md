# Project Overview

An accelerator with practical examples of using these components to achieve an end-to-end workflow from data cleaning, EDA and visualization to model, feature stores, model training, serving deployment and monitoring.

## Features

- Entirely code-driven for a customizable workflow
- Supports:
  - Experiment Tracking via MLFlow
  - Feature Store ising Feast
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Custom Python packages
  - Training Pipelines Examples 
  - Inference Pipelines Examples

### Getting Started

The "toolkit" itself is located in the src folder and includes a Python cookiecutter package so folder structure can be customized.

Launch the platform by running

```docker compose up```

inside the infrastructure folder (a helm version can be added in future for cloud deployments).

A step-by-step approach to building this toolkit located in src is given in my book [*MLOps Lifecycle Toolkit*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9642-4) (Apress, 2023) where many tools in this list were evaluated (something close to 100 open source tool). Feel free to contribute more tools, re-organize the list or add new categories.
h diverse backgrounds to build a robust and versatile toolkit that can be used across industries. 

## Contributing:

To contribute, simply fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Refer to the [Contributing.md](Contributing.md) file for detailed information on how to contribute to this open-source project.

Let's collaborate to build a comprehensive and dynamic resource that empowers the data science community!
